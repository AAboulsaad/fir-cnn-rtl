SystemVerilog for implementing MATLAB neural net onto Xilinx RFSoC.

#### Alex Knowlton, Ahmed Arefaat, Elpida Karepepera

## Methodology
Three layers to implement:
- ReLU Layer
- Fully-Connected Layer
- Convolutional Layer

The trick is to figure out how to quantize, parametrize, and store the neural net so that it can be efficiently implemented on the FPGA.
